Iteration 1 - Core Values

Feature: Create a Character
  As a character, I want to have a name so I can distinguish myself from other characters
  * Get / Set name

Feature: Attributes
  As a character, I want attributes to determine the things I am and am not good at
  * Attributes are Weapon Skill, Strength, Toughness, Willpower
  * They are defaulted to 10
  * They can be randomized by rolling 2 10 sided dice and adding their results
  * Attributes have a bonus which is the number in the tens place
    * ie a Strength of 17 has a Strength Bonus of +1

Feature: Species
  As a character, I want the ability to be a human
  * As a human, they get a +20 bonus to all attribute scores.

Feature: Wounds
  As a character, I want the ability to determine how much damage I can take
  * Your Wounds "attribute" is determined by Strength Bonus + (2x Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus
  * Wounds can be reduced and once Wounds reaches 0, a character becomes Prone (discussed later?)
  * If you do not regain any Wounds within a number of Rounds = to your Toughness Bonus, you will pass out, gaining the Unconcious condition
  * Wounds can never be below 0

Feature: Damage
  As a character, I want the ability to take damage
  * When taking damage, a character reduces the incoming damage by their Toughness Bonus
    * This can only reduce the damage to 1, it cannot negate it completely
  * Damage should never be tracked as more than the wounds you could take
  * Evenutally add hit locations...

Feature: Critical Wounds
  As a character, I want the ability to suffer truly debilitating effects
  * When at 0 Wounds or taking more damage than Wounds you have left, you suffer a Critical Wounds
  * If you suffer fewer negative wounds than your Toughness Bonus (-4 wounds compared to 4 Toughness Bonus), you subtract -20 from the Critical Table result with a minimum result of 01.
  * Eventually add hit locations and critical wounds tables...
  
Feature: Death
  As a character, I want the ability to be declared declared
  * When a character has the Unconcious condition, and wounds are equal to 0, then compare the number of Critical Wounds to your Toughness Bonus.
    * If you have more wounds than the toughness bonus, you are pronounced dead at the end of the round.

Feature: The melee skill
  As a character, I want the ability to have knowledge in melee combat to determine my skill's level
  * The melee skill uses the Weapon Skill Score as its base number then adds "advances" from training to determine the skill's level.
  * 41 Weapon Skill + 5 Melee(Basic) = 46 Skill Level)

Feature: Attack (Melee Skill Test)
  As a character, I want the ability to attack another character.
  * Roll 2 10 sided dice, one being the tens place, and one being the units place
  * Subtract the rolled result from your Melee Skill.
  * Determine your attack's Success Level like attribute bonuses (46 Melee Skill Level - 34 Attack Roll = 12,  Math.Floor(12 / 10) = +1 SL)

Feature: Fend off attacks
  As a character, I want the ability to fend off the attack when I am attacked
  * Make a Melee Skill Test as the previous Feature when attacked and return the success level to the attacker
  * Compare the attacker's Success Level versus the Defender's Success Level negate any damage if the defender is the higher
  * The defender takes no damage if the levels are the same

Feature: Advantage
  As a character I want the ability to press my advantage in combat
  * After succeeding in an Opposed Melee Skill Test with an opponent, gain a point of Advantage
  * When determining future Melee Skill Tests with the same opponent, add a +10 to your Melee Skill Level for each point of Advantage
  * When your Melee Skill Test's Success Level is the same as your opponents, do not gain any advantage
  * When taking damage or leaving combat, lose all Advantage
  * When taking no damage but gaining no Advntage in a round of combat, lose 1 point of Advantage
